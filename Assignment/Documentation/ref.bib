	doi = {10.1145/3267955.3267972},
	abstract = {In this paper we present the design of a transport layer and socket API that can be used in several ICN architectures such as NDN, CCN and hICN. The current design makes it possible to expose an API that is simple to insert in current applications and easy to use to develop novel ones. The proliferation of connected applications for very different use cases and services with wide spectrum of requirements suggests that several transport services will coexist in the Internet. This is just about to happen with QUIC, MPTCP, LEDBAT as the most notable ones but is expected to grow and diversify with the advent of applications for 5G, IoT, MEC with heterogeneous connectivity. The advantages of ICN have to be measurable from the application, end-services and in the network, with relevant key performance indicators. We have implemented an high speed transport stack with most of the designed features that we present in this paper with extensive experiments and benchmarks to show the scalability of the current systems in different use cases.},

	doi = {10.1109/PROC.1985.13317},
	abstract = {Network synchronization deals with the problem of distributing time and frequency among spatially remote locations. Network synchronization is an integral part of any large communication system, such as the telephone network. It also plays an important role in many diverse applications like navigation and position determination, computer communication, data gathering, control and command systems, and phased-array antennas. The purpose of this paper is to introduce the reader to the subject of network synchronization by organizing and presenting a tutorial of the theoretical work accomplished to date. Since the subject material is scattered, disconnected, and couched in different notations, the authors have long felt that it would be significant to organize the material and present the reader with an overview of the growth of the subject. A by-product of such a review should serve as an aid to set direction for future studies and research work. The paper begins by providing the classification of networks into plesiochronous (asynchronous) and synchronous. Further breakdown of this basic classification into a tree-structure hierarchy is presented. Since the time and frequency waveforms transmitted between nodes experience propagation delay, some form of ranging system application is usually required in order to compensate for these delays. Several delay compensation techniques are described and incorporated into a more detailed classification of the synchronization systems. This is then followed by presenting functional network models from which a generic and unified mathematical model is formulated. Network performance measures are defined and the mathematical model is used to characterize the synchronization behavior of the network in terms of these measures. Emphasis is placed on characterizing and understanding network stability, steady-state behavior, effects of clock phase noise, and channel thermal noise. The nonlinear behavior of synchronization systems is also explored. Numerous applications are pointed out and a rather complete list (unfortunately nonexhaustive) of the references is provided for the purpose of directing future research work.},

	title = {Using an {ICN} {Approach} to {Support} {Multiple} {Controllers} in {OpenFlow}},
	abstract = {Information Centric Networking (ICN) is an innovative direction for next generation networks. It is a concept of networking paradigm which is considered as a new technique for future search activities. ICN is based on caching contents in several nodes and replicating these contents. It provides contents requested by users from the nearest node instead of creating a communication channel between sender and receiver just for calling information. This paper aims to scale OpenFlow network in traffic engineering by reducing number of transactions, predicting and pre-populating flow entries using the ICN approach. In addition, the paper shows the advantages of implementing ICN designs within OpenFlow. The proposed approach aims to implement ICN concepts to enhance OpenFlow network. This will enable the deployment of networking solutions in the existing network infrastructure and will lead to more flexibility in OpenFlow network. In addition, OpenFlow will have a global management view for all connected networks managed by different controllers. The proposed solution can fulfill current management and utilization of network demands. The paper then debates the implementation of ICN's design and features based on Software Defined Networking (SDN).},

	doi = {10.1016/S1389-1286(01)00311-5},
	abstract = {This paper discusses the application of TCP tunnels on the Internet and how Internet traffic can benefit from the congestion control mechanism of the tunnels. Primarily, we show the TCP tunnels offer TCP-friendly flows protection from TCP-unfriendly traffic. TCP tunnels also reduce the many flows situation on the Internet to that of a few flows. In addition, TCP tunnels eliminate unnecessary packet loss in the core routers of the congested backbones, which waste precious bandwidth leading to congestion collapse due to unresponsive UDP flows. We finally highlight that the use of TCP tunnels can, in principle, help prevent certain forms of congestion collapse described by Floyd and Fall [IEEE/ACM Trans Networking 7 (4) (1999) 458].
The deployment of TCP tunnels on the Internet and the issues involved are also discussed and we conclude that with the recent RFC2309 recommendation of using random early drop as the default packet-drop policy in Internet routers, coupled with the implementation of a pure tunnel environment on backbone networks makes the deployment of TCP tunnels a feasible endeavour worthy of further investigation.},

	abstract = {There is still network congestion in ICN, and the transmission control is essential in ICN. Because ICN transport is different from the transport in IP networks, TCP in ICN has some special features such as receiver-driven mode and connectionless. This paper analyzes that conventional TCP can't be directly applied to ICN according to ICN transport features. By analyzing the algorithms of each TCP edition, we give a conclusion that only Tahoe can be applied to ICN after simple modification. Furthermore, this paper advances Tahoe for ICN-ITahoe design and implementation. Then, we simulate ITahoe protocol in ICN based test bed and verify that ITahoe has better efficiency than Tahoe and ICTP.},

AMT is designed to provide a mechanism for a migration path to a fully multicast-enabled backbone in the future. As part of a larger project using AMT to extend the reach of multicast sessions, we have performed formal validation of the three-way handshake process between an AMT gateway and its coupled AMT relay by modeling it using the AVISPA tools (Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications). We have identified two security problems where an intruder can impersonate an AMT Relay or an AMT Gateway. Furthermore, an intruder can make use of this impersonation to disconnect valid sessions of other legitimate participants.},

In this work, we use OpenVPN as a platform to demonstrate the performance between TCP/UDP.

However the effects of transmitting TCP within a UDP tunnel has been explored and could provide a valuable attempt. The results provided in this paper demonstrates that indeed TCP in UDP tunnel provides better latency. Throughout this paper, a series of tests have been performed, UDP traffic was sent inside UDP tunnel and TCP tunnel successively. The same tests was performed using TCP traffic.},
