	abstract = {The comparison between TCP and UDP tunnels have not been sufficiently reported in the scientific literature. In this work, we use OpenVPN as a platform to demonstrate the performance between TCP/UDP. The de facto belief has been that TCP tunnel provides a permanent tunnel and therefore ensures a reliable transfer of data between two end points. However the effects of transmitting TCP within a UDP tunnel has been explored and could provide a valuable attempt. The results provided in this paper demonstrates that indeed TCP in UDP tunnel provides better latency. Throughout this paper, a series of tests have been performed, UDP traffic was sent inside UDP tunnel and TCP tunnel successively. The same tests was performed using TCP traffic.},
